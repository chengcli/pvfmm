# How to compile pvmm
1. Install dependencies
```
brew bundle
```

2. Init git submodule
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

3. make build directory
```
mkdir build
```

4. configure the code
`libomp` is keg-only in `homebrew`, which means it was not symlinked into `/opt/homebrew`,
because it can override GCC headers and result in broken builds. So, you have to specify
its path manually.
```
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/ ..
```

5. compile the code
```
make -j4
```
